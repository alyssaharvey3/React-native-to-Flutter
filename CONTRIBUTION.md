### Bugs and Improvements

We use the issue tracker to keep track of bugs and improvements to React Native to Flutter Widgets itself, its examples, and the documentation. We encourage you to open issues to discuss improvements, architecture, theory, internal implementation, etc. If a topic has been discussed before, we will ask you to join the previous discussion.

### Sending a Pull Request

For non-trivial changes, please open an issue with a proposal for a new feature or refactoring before starting on the work. We don't want you to waste your efforts on a pull request that we won't want to accept.

In general, the contribution workflow looks like this:

- Open a new issue in the [Issue tracker](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/react-native-to-flutter/issues).
- Fork the repo.
- Create a new feature branch based off the `main` branch.
- Make sure all tests pass and there are no linting errors.
- Submit a pull request, referencing any issues it addresses.

Please try to keep your pull request focused in scope and avoid including unrelated commits.

After you have submitted your pull request, we'll try to get back to you as soon as possible. We may suggest some changes or improvements.

Thank you for contributing!
